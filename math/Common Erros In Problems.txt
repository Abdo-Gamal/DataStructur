TLE time limit Exceed  check : 

●	Check size of array should be same size of problem + 7.
●	Calculate complexity of code  product all size of loops that inside others  and this number should be less than < 10^8.
●	Check if  any loop go to infinite .
●	If problem have file check that you makefile and put names correct.

WR Wrong answer : 

●	Read the problem statement again and ensure that you understand problem well and not missing anything. 
●	Check size of array should be same size of problem + 7.
●	Check if need long long or not.
●	Check  the output format same or not like he need to print “YES” and you print “Yes”  or he need to print numbers
 1 2 3 and you print same numbers put you print after 3 space and he not
●	Check constraint of input number might be huge and should store in string and you store it in long long.
●	Check if you may need to use unsigned long long or double 
●	Check that  you may get overflow or not then you should change code or equation to not make overflow like this 
   a * b / c it can be  a * (b /c)  divide first the product 
  

Runtime:
●	Check size of array.
●	Check if you divide by zero
